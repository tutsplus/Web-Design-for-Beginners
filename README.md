# Web Design for Beginners | FREE COURSE

As a beginner you’ll probably have the same questions I did when I first started:

> > “How do I pick typefaces, how do I pick colors, what about icons—how do I use them correctly, where do I get them, what the heck is whitespace, how do I position and size elements correctly?”

These are exactly the kinds of questions which we’ll address in this course. 

In terms of fundamentals you’ll learn about color, typography, spacing, sizing, and imagery. We’ll also cover Responsive Web Design. In each of these lessons we’ll discuss the theory, best practices, and some tools you can use to make your job easier.

When it comes to common patterns, you’ll learn about the various elements you can use to design a web page. Things like headers, hero areas, buttons, image galleries, contact forms, and more.

For each of these patterns we’ll look at the definition and some use cases, then we’ll apply that knowledge to a demo project; a 3-page portfolio website designed specifically for this course.
