In terms of fundamentals, you’ll learn about color, typography, spacing, sizing, imagery, and responsive web design. We’ll discuss the theory, best practices, and some tools you can use to make your job easier.

When it comes to common web design patterns, you’ll learn about the elements you can use to design a web page—things like headers, hero areas, buttons, image galleries, contact forms, and more.

For each of these patterns, we’ll look at the definition and some use cases, and then we’ll apply that knowledge to a demo project: a three-page portfolio website designed specifically for this course.
